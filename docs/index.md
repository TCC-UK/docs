# **About Juji Platform**

operation of a new generation of Conversational Artificial
Intelligence (AI) Assistants. Currently, these advanced AI assistants
engage users in a text-based, natural language conversations to
accomplish a wide variety of tasks, such as answering user inquiries
and making personalized product recommendations. Also known as **AI
chatbots**, these AI assistants can handle complex and diverse user
inquiries, infer users' implicit needs and wants, and use such
understanding to deliver truly hyper-personalized guidance and

  **[Juji Studio](/juji-studio)** provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for
  **everyone**, with or without technical skills or AI knowledge, to
  rapidly create, customize, test, and deploy AI chatbots **with no
  coding required**.

  **[Juji IDE](/juji-ide)** enables people with minimal coding skills (e.g.,
  ability to write HTML) to power AI chatbots with advanced capabilities (e.g.,
  customizing product recommendation policies). It provides an
  interactive development environment that allows chatbot developers
  to write, compile, and preview AI chatbots using a high-level, [chatbot
  scripting language](https://docs.juji.io/reference/).

  **[Juji API](/api)** enables software engineers to embed AI chatbots in
    different applications (e.g., mobile or web-based
    applications). While Juji Studio supports the rapid creation and
    customization of an AI chatbot, [Juji
    API](https://docs.juji.io/api/) allows rapid and easy integration
    of such a chatbot into third-party applications.
