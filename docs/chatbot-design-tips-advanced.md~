## **Give Sensible Labels**

The label of a free-text request is used for multiple purposes. It is
used to summarize the topic (see the topic card on the left panel) and
also used to index user answers to the request in an audience report.

More importantly, it is used to find a matched Juji built-in dialog to
handle user responses to the request. For example, Juji has a built-in
dialog that handles diverse user responses to the request `What are
your hobbies`. To find such a built-in dialog, Juji uses the entered
label. Giving a sensible lable thus can better help Juji find the
right built-in conversation, which can then handle diverse user
responses on that topic with no or little customization required.

In particular, we suggest that you give short, concise labels to
distill chatbot requests, which facilitates the finding of matched 
built-in dialogs. For example, if your chatbot is intended to ask a
user about his/her opinion about an event, it might give a long
description of the event before posing the question. In such a case,
put the long and full description in the request, but keep the
request label short and concise as shown in the example below:

<p align="center"><img src="../img/good-label.png" alt="A sensible label" width="650"/></p>

Here is another example showing that the request wording is long while
the label is kept short and to the point:

<p align="center"><img src="/img/good-label-2.png" alt="A sensible
label 2" width="550"/></p>

In case you don't think the label you entered retrieves a suitable
built-in dialog, you can always browse Juji dialog library to [search
for a more suitable built-in dialog](/design#built-in-dialog).
