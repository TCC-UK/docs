# **Deploy AI Chatbot**

Juji AI chatbots can be deployed to a website or to a Facebook
Messenger on a Facebook page.

## **Deploy to Website**

When deploying a chatbot to a website, one can customize the **web
cover** page. As shown below, one can edit the **welcome message** and
configure the fields to be shown on the cover page:

* First Name (required)
* Last Name (optional)
* Email (optional)

Use the `Generate URL` button to generate a web URL. This URL can then
be embedded into an email or a website for target audience.

<p align="center"><img src="/img/web-url.png" alt="generate URL" width="650"/></p>

Two URLs are generated:

* **Test URL** Give this URL to testers so that the chat data can be
  identified as test data easily.

* **Regular URL** Use this URL for target audience. 


## **Deploy to Facebook Page**

One can deploy a Juji chatbot to a Facebook Messenger associated with
a Facebook page.

Similar to deploying to a website, one can also edit the **weclome
message** shown up in a Facebook Messenger. Click on the green
`Checklist` to make a Facebook page ready to host a chatbot.

Use the blue `Connect with Facebook` button to deploy a
chatbot. Select the page(s) you want to deploy to. Then click on the
green `Deploy` button to complete the deployment.

If there is no page listed, it means that you need to give Juji
permissions to deploy your chatbot to one or more your Facebook
pages. In that case, click on the green `Connect More` button to
select Facebook pages and give permissions. The permitted pages should
then show up in a list and you can then select one or more to deploy a
chatbot to.  

## **Update Deployed Chatbot**

It's possible that a chatbot is updated after its deployment. To push
the new updates to the deployment, Juji supports two types of update:

* **Update Existing Release** Use the `Update` button on the Facebook
    deployment page (see below) or the one under the
    `Manage` button to push the updates to the existing chatbot. The
    updated chatbot will restart and reflect the changes made.

* **New Release** Use the `Connect with Facebook` button or `New
    Release` button under `Manage` to release a new version of the
    chatbot. The a release version will be created. When chatbot updates are
    substantial, we recommend to make a new release since one will be
    able to compare audience behavior under different releases.

## **What's Next**

Once a chatbot is deployed, you can monitor its status and the
associated audience information. Please check out [**Report
Dashboard**](reports.md) to deploy your AI chatbot.
