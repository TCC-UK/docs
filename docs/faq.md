<hr>
**Why does my chatbot take my question?**

My chatbot asks a question, such as "I can help you now. What can I help you with today?".  But when a user asks a question, the chatbot does not answer and I have to ask it again as shown below.

<p align="center"><img src="/img/pseudo-q.png" alt="Design page" width="350px"/></p>

: Juji chatbots send two types of messages, one is just a message without waiting for a user to respond, the other is a "true" request, which will wait for a user to respond. To take a user input, make sure your question is a "true" question. Check the card associated with your question and make sure it looks like T5 below instead of T6. A "true" request/question has a chat icon associated with the card (T5), while a plain message does not have it (T6). When you want your chatbot to send a true question, make sure you choose `Make a Request` option as shown below:
