<hr>
**What’s the difference between a `Message` and a `Request`?**

<hr>
**What is custom-topic and how to write it?**
: Custom-topic allows you to customize the way you would like the bot to respond to users’ inputs. Topics are the primary building blocks of the chatbot’s conversation. The [concept page](concept.md) of the Juji documentation provides detailed explanation on how to write a topic.

<hr>
**How can I customized the chatbot’s response to participants' answers in open-ended questions?**
: You can use both [Juji Studio](/juji-studio) or [Juji IDE](/juji-ide) to customize chatbot responses. Also check out [Chatbot Design](/design) for specifics. 

<hr>
**Does the chatbot work with interview questions which have primarily choice answers, and need only the chatbot’s help to draw out responses for those who select “other” in their multiple choice answer?**
: Yes, we support choice questions, open-ended questions, and other types of questions. Although we recommend our users to take advantage of our AI powered conversation skills and personality analysis by using open-ended questions, our chatbot works perfectly in chat with primarily choice questions. The AI chatbot can be easily set up to collect extra responses when interviewee select "other" in a multiple choice question.

<hr>
**Will Juji keep a copy of user contact information and their responses? Will Juji retain rights to use them?**

: Juji holds privacy at the very heart of our
product. We do not actively collect contact information from chatbot
users. It is up to chatbot creators to decide if such information is
to be collected. Although we keep chat logs, they are secured using
industry standard secure protocols. Regarding details of our use of
the data collected and other privacy concerns, please refer to our
privacy policy at https://juji.io/util/juji-privacy-policy.pdf.

<hr>
**Will the persona I choose affect the way s/he responds to users?**
: Yes, different persona may have different responses depending on the context of the chat. Please check our publication regarding the [effect of chatbot personality](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3232077&dl=ACM&coll=DL).

<hr>
**If I give you the type of audience and information I am after, can you help me choose a fitting persona?**
: We can help you choose a fitting persona if you provide more information about the interview you would like to conduct.

<hr>
**I don’t want to collect any identifying information such as email addresses or last names**
: On the web deployment, you can choose whether or not you want to collect email and/or last name from your chatbot end-users. The first name is mandatory for the chatbot to properly address the user in conversation.

<hr>
**Why didn't my chatbot take my question?**

My chatbot asks a question, such as "I can help you now. What can I help you with today?".  But when a user asks a question, the chatbot does not answer and I have to ask it again as shown below.

<p align="center"><img src="/img/wrong-q.png" alt="Design page" width="350px"/></p>


: Juji chatbots send two types of messages, one is just a message without waiting for a user to respond, the other is a "true" request, which will wait for a user to respond. To take a user input, make sure your question is a "true" question. Check the card associated with your question and make sure it looks like T5 below instead of T6. A "true" request/question has a chat icon associated with the card (T5), while a plain message does not have it (T6). 

<p align="center"><img src="/img/pseudo-q.png" alt="Design page" width="350px"/></p>

When you want your chatbot to send a true question, make sure you choose `Make a Request` option as shown below:

<p align="center"><img src="/img/design-topic-type.png" alt="add a
topic buttons" width="550"/></p>


<hr>
**What capabilities will we have to sync to SalesForce or Marketo?**


: Currently you can export all your chat data to a CSV file, which can
then be easily imported into third-party applications, such as
SalesForce and Marketo. Check out [how to eport to CSV](/reports#export-audience-data). If you have specific data-export requirements, please feel free to write to us (support@juji.io).

<hr>
**Will we be able to go into the chatbot at any time and make changes after it goes live?**


: Yes, Juji Studio allows you to do so very easily and quickly. Check out the instructions under [Design](/design).

<hr>
**How long will it take to create an AI chatbot?**


: This depends on the purpose of your chatbot. For example, if you
want to create an e-commerce chatbot that introduces products and
answer customer questions, it may take from a couple of hours to a few
days, during which most of the time will be spent on coming up and
entering the Q&A pairs. If you already have a list of Q&As and your
product list is short, it would then be rather fast. For example, it
would take just a few minutes to get the first version up and running
and then a couple of hours to fine-tune it if you wish to do so.

<hr>
**How long normally can a user chat with a Juji chatbot?**

: Again, this depends on the purpose of your chatbot. An interview
chatbot may chat with its users for a long period of time (e.g., 45
minutes), while an e-commerce chatbot may chat with its users for a
few minutes (e.g., 5 minutes) to help resolve user issues. Please
check out [how to determine the optimal chat length](/chatbot-design-tips#optimal-chat-length).

<hr>
**How will my chatbot be improved over time? Does it improve if more people use it?**

: Your chatbot will get improved over time from two aspects. First, it will be improved if you inject more knowledge into your chatbot. Second, it will also be improved when Juji improves its underlying dialog library. Juji constantly improves its dialog library based on all Juji chatbot usage and behavior. In other words, more Juji chatbots are in action, the better all the Juji chatbots will get, and the faster all the Juji chatbots will be improved. There is indeed a network effect for Juji chatbots.

<hr>
**After I deploy my chatbot, what should I do then?**

: One wise chatbot developer says that raising a chatbot is similar to
raising a child, you should monitor your chatbot and feed your chatbot
with new knowledge periodically to improve it and help it grow. Juji
provides you with dashboards to [monitor the Q&A
status](/design#customize-qa-and-fallback) as well as [monior the
audience interaction](/reports) with your chatbot.

: We strongly recommend that you check your chatbot via the dashboards
periodically. If you don't have time to do so, you may want to hire a
professional (e.g., a chatbot agency) who can help you monitor and
maintain your chatbot.

<hr>
**Should I create a chatbot on Facebook Messenger or on my website**

: If you maintain a Facebook page or group and use this channel to
engage with your target audience frequently, we recommend that you deploy a
chatbot to your Facebook Messenger that attaches to your Facebook page
or group. A Facebook Messenger chatbot has several advantages over a web-based deployment:

: * Easy to deploy
: * Easy to personalize a chat for an opt-in user
: * Can be synced with Facebook posts or ads
: * Native to any mobile devices
: * Always on

<hr>
**Will my users/audience see my project name?**

: As shown below, your project name is internal to you, while the AI chatbot name is external to your audience.

<p align="center"><img src="/img/project-name-chatbot-name.png" alt="Project Name vs. Chatbot Name" width="650px"/></p>

<hr>
**How can I capture a user's emoji like "thumbs up" and respond to it using an emoji?**

: In Juji, you can capture user emoji input in two ways. One is to capture the keyboard input of an emoji. For example, the keyboard input for the smiling face emoji is :-). To capture such a smiling face input and respond to it with a same emoji, you can create a trigger that uses `matches` pattern and then respond to this pattern using the keyboard input:

<p align="center"><img src="/img/handle-emoji-1.png" alt="Handle Emoji" width="450px"/></p>

: Here is the chat result that shows a user's emoji input and the corresponding chatbot emoji response: 

<p align="center"><img src="/img/handle-emoji-1-result.png" alt="Handle Emoji Result" width="550px"/></p>

: Another way of capturing emojis is to directly copy and paste an emoji into a pattern as shown below (note that you must quote the emoji):

<p align="center"><img src="/img/handle-emoji-2.png" alt="Handle Emoji" width="450px"/></p>

: Here is the chat result that shows a user's emoji input and the corresponding chatbot emoji response: 

<p align="center"><img src="/img/handle-emoji-2-result.png" alt="Handle Emoji Result" width="550px"/></p>

: In addition, Juji's built-in dialogs automatically handle many types of emojis. If you just want to use Juji default responses to user emojis, you don't need to do anything. The example below shows such a default Juji response to a user's frowning face emoji.

<p align="center"><img src="/img/default-emoji-response.png" alt="Handle Emoji Result" width="550px"/></p>
