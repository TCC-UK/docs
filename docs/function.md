These functions can be used in REP script directly without namespace. The first argument of these functions is always `rep`, the reference to the REP chatbot itself. It should be omitted when calling the functions in REP script. For example, `(user-first-name)` is the right way to call the function `(juji.func.user/user-first-name rep)`.
