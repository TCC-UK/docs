# Juji's Built-in Library Topics
Juji's built-in topics can be used freely in a script after requiring their [namespaces](reference.md#namespace). Regardless of their intended use, a built-in topic is just like any [topic](concept.md#topic) and can be used anywhere a topic can be used.

## Fallback topics
Most updated fallback topics reside in the `juji.topics.fallback.v3` namespace. They are usually used as [ad-lib topics](concept.md#ad-lib-topic) to handle input that is unexpected in or unspecific to the current [agenda topic](concept.md#ad-lib-topic) or its subtopics. Most of the built-in fallback topics do not expect any argument.

| `(handle-missed-user-answers)`              | user-answered            | This fallback topic handles situations where a user already provided requested information but an AI agent somehow missed it.

In such a case, the AI will act accordingly, e.g., checking if the input is there or needs to re-ask.                    |

For example, a user may make a comment ("I'm sad") or an acknowledgement (e.g., "cool").                                                                                                                                                  |

## Interviewing Topics
