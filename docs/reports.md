# **Monitor AI Chatbot**

Once a chatbot is deployed, the `Reports` dashboard displays the chat
stats and the audience information.

## **Chat Stats**

This dashboard currently shows the number of users who chatted with
the chatbot. One can use the date slider below the chart to view the
number of users per selected time period.

## **Audience Dashboard**

Juji displays audience information in two parts.

### Audience Overview

Audience overview is displayed in a table. The table shows several
pieces of information related to users, such as `name`, `location`,
and `channel`.

### Audience Analytics

Juji automatically analyze audience information, such as user answers
to specific chatbot requests or distribution of custom attribute
values. Such analytic results are organized and displayed by
conversation topic or custom attribute. Below is an example displaying
the distribution of user choices by percentile to the question `What's your
favorite color`.

For an open-ended question, Juji summarizes the free-text user answers
to the question by themes (topics) and displays the discovered themes
with the highest coverage. Below is an example showing the themes
discovered for the question `What subject do you teach`:
